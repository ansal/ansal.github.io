I almost work over 8 hours per day these days. Before I started freelancing fulltime, I had plenty of time to try new things and deepen my existing knowledge. I used to roam around in NPM world for new node packages, find something interesting, install it on my machine and there goes my whole day. But I loved it.

Nowadays I find myself writing the same Backbone and Django code again and again. I am getting a feeling that I am losing touch with latest tech and trends. Two things that I want to learn really well since last year November are [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) and [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/). The recent announcements of [React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVZ-P-ZI6W4) and tools like [6to5](http://6to5.org/) make me want to stop all the work I am doing, learn those things and build something cool. I want to learn these two things well as they are the future and I believe mastering them will add a lot of value to my work. But there are tons of other stuff I want to try out. I keep scanning sites like Hacker News and see people doing super cool stuff with some exotic technologies.

But I can't stop my work. I had made promises with people. I have to keep working. After all the skype calls, reviews and coding I dont have energy to work on a side project.

So how can I stay on top of these things still working and earning?

Since I am freelancing instead of working fulltime, I am lucky enough to choose people who I want to work with. I am trying to work with people who doesn't care about which technology I am using as long as I am getting things done. This way I can learn new stuff and still get paid for that.

Its not that easy to find such a client. Most people who contacted me for work came with a preset mind about some technologies and demanded me to use them without knowing strength and weakness of those technologies. I had to turn down a number of offers like these in the past. And clients are the toughest things in the business of freelancing!

How do you keep learning new stuff these days? I would love to hear that!
