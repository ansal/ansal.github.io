I haven't posted anything here in about six months. Mostly, I have been busy with my contract work and my own projects. But, it is also due to the fact that blogging is hard for me.

I have about 12 posts sitting in my drafts folder, mostly about some ideas I want to say to the world and some technical stuff I have picked up during my work. But, once I am about to finish, I feel like the post is pointless and is not conveying my thought effectively.

I have to get over this feeling. So, as time permits, I am going to post a few of them here. Consider this as my blog's version 2.
